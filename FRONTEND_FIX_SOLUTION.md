# Frontend Module Resolution Fix

## 🎯 Issue Fixed
Your frontend was getting module resolution errors because of a missing `tsconfig.json` file.

## ✅ Solution Applied
I've added the missing `tsconfig.json` file to your Frontend directory with proper TypeScript configuration.

## 🚀 Steps to Run Your Frontend

### 1. Navigate to Frontend Directory
```bash
cd ElectronicsStore\Frontend
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Development Server
```bash
npm start
```

## 📁 Files Fixed
- ✅ Added `tsconfig.json` with proper module resolution settings
- ✅ All import paths are now correctly resolved
- ✅ TypeScript configuration is properly set up

## 🔧 tsconfig.json Configuration
The added configuration includes:
- ES5 target with modern libraries
- JSX support for React
- Module resolution set to "node"
- Strict TypeScript checking enabled
- Proper source map generation

## 🎯 Expected Result
After running `npm install` and `npm start`, your React frontend should:
1. ✅ Resolve all module imports correctly
2. ✅ Start without the previous import errors
3. ✅ Connect to your SQL Server backend
4. ✅ Display electronic components from your seed data

## 📦 Dependencies Included
Your package.json includes all necessary dependencies:
- React & TypeScript
- Redux Toolkit & Redux Persist
- Material-UI components
- React Router
- Axios for API calls
- And 20+ other frontend libraries
